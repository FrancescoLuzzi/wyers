// The Myers algorithm is based on a matrix:
// - a's chars in the columns (index[0..N])
// - b's chars in the rows (index[0..M])
// moving right represents deleting the char of the column that you are moving from
// moving down represents inserting a char of the column that you are moving from
// moving diagonally represents NOOP (chars are equal)
// the final and optimized algorithm rotates the matrix by 45°
// The coordinate system will become:
// - d represents the x coordinate, the iteration of the algorithm (d[0..N+M])
// - k represents the y coordinate, and it represents the operation for the current character (k[-d..d], depends on the iteration)
// "k+1" represents deleting the char of the column that you are moving from
// "k-1" represents inserting the char of the column that you are moving from
// "k" represents NOOP (chars are equal)
// the cell in the dxk matrix represents the index of the char being deleted from "a" or interted from "b"
// this is the Myers algorithm, by default it returns "d", the min number of changes that transform "a" into "b"
// to expand it to know WHICH changes have been made, we need to keep track of all the changes at each iteration
